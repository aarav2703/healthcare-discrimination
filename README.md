# Health Inequities Dashboard

## Project Overview

This project involves the development of an interactive dashboard to monitor and analyze health inequities using public health data. The dashboard leverages data from the CDC and WHO to visualize trends, correlations, and combined analyses of mortality rates and life expectancy. The primary goal is to provide insights into health disparities across different states and countries.

## Objectives

1. **Trend Analysis**: Visualize the trend of mortality rates over the years to identify any significant changes or patterns.
2. **Correlation Analysis**: Explore the correlation between age-adjusted mortality rates and the number of deaths.
3. **Heatmap Analysis**: Provide a heatmap to show age-adjusted mortality rates by state and year.
4. **Life Expectancy Analysis**: Visualize the average life expectancy by country.
5. **Combined Data Analysis**: Integrate CDC and WHO data to analyze the relationship between deaths and life expectancy.

## Data Sources

- **CDC Data**: Mortality data sourced from the CDC's public databases, including crude death rates, age-adjusted rates, and related metrics.
- **WHO Data**: Life expectancy data sourced from the WHO's Global Health Observatory (GHO) database.

## Tools and Technologies

- **Python**: The primary programming language used for data processing and analysis.
- **Pandas**: Used for data manipulation and cleaning.
- **Plotly**: Utilized for creating interactive visualizations.
- **Dash**: Framework used to build the interactive dashboard.
- **Google Colab**: Environment for developing and testing the code.

## Key Steps and Methodologies

1. **Data Acquisition**: Data was fetched from CDC and WHO APIs, ensuring real-time access and updates.
2. **Data Cleaning and Preprocessing**: Both datasets were cleaned and preprocessed to ensure consistency and compatibility for merging and analysis.
3. **Trend Analysis**: Trends in mortality rates were analyzed and visualized using line charts.
4. **Correlation Analysis**: The relationship between age-adjusted mortality rates and deaths was explored through scatter plots and correlation coefficients.
5. **Heatmap Visualization**: A heatmap was created to display age-adjusted mortality rates by state and year.
6. **Life Expectancy Analysis**: Average life expectancy by country was visualized using bar charts.
7. **Combined Data Analysis**: CDC and WHO data were merged to analyze the combined effects on mortality and life expectancy.

## Dashboard Features

- **Trend Analysis Tab**: Displays the trend of mortality rates over the years using line charts.
- **Correlation Analysis Tab**: Shows the correlation between age-adjusted mortality rates and deaths using scatter plots with trendlines.
- **Heatmap Analysis Tab**: Provides a heatmap visualization of age-adjusted mortality rates by state and year.
- **Life Expectancy Tab**: Visualizes the average life expectancy by country using bar charts.
- **Combined Data Analysis Tab**: Combines CDC and WHO data to analyze deaths and life expectancy through scatter plots.

### Data Visualization and Insights

Our project analyzes health inequities by examining mortality rates and life expectancy data from the CDC and WHO. The heatmap of age-adjusted mortality rates by state and year reveals significant disparities, with states like Tennessee and South Carolina consistently showing higher mortality rates, while states like California and Arizona exhibit lower rates. This pattern suggests geographic disparities in health outcomes that may be influenced by factors such as access to healthcare, socioeconomic conditions, and public health policies.

The bar chart showcasing average life expectancy by country highlights stark contrasts across nations. Developed countries such as Switzerland and Japan boast higher life expectancies, whereas developing countries like Afghanistan and Zambia report lower figures. These disparities underscore the impact of economic development, healthcare infrastructure, and social determinants of health on population longevity.

Our combined analysis of deaths and life expectancy further emphasizes the complex relationship between mortality and life expectancy. Although there is no clear linear correlation, clusters of states with high death rates tend to fall within specific life expectancy ranges, indicating potential areas for targeted interventions.

The scatter plot examining the correlation between age-adjusted mortality rates and deaths, with a trendline, demonstrates a positive but weak correlation (approximately 0.065). This suggests that while higher age-adjusted mortality rates are associated with higher numbers of deaths, other factors also significantly influence mortality outcomes.

Finally, the trend analysis of mortality rates over the years reveals a concerning increase, particularly since the early 2000s. This upward trajectory highlights the growing public health challenge and the need for continuous monitoring and intervention to address the underlying causes of rising mortality rates.

These visualizations collectively provide a comprehensive understanding of health inequities, emphasizing the need for targeted public health strategies to address disparities in mortality and life expectancy across different regions and populations.
