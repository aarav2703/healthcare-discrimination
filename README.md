# Health Inequities Dashboard

## Project Overview

This project involves the development of an interactive dashboard to monitor and analyze health inequities using public health data. The dashboard leverages data from the CDC and WHO to visualize trends, correlations, and combined analyses of mortality rates and life expectancy. The primary goal is to provide insights into health disparities across different states and countries.

# [Note-The code was run on Google Colab and the dashboard was visualized using dash, The dashboard and visualizations are not being shown when the notebook is being saved in GitHub-a pf showing outputs has been attached as well as the notebooks-To access the complete outputs and interactive Dashboard please run in google colab]

## Objectives

1. **Trend Analysis**: Visualize the trend of mortality rates over the years to identify any significant changes or patterns.
2. **Correlation Analysis**: Explore the correlation between age-adjusted mortality rates and the number of deaths.
3. **Heatmap Analysis**: Provide a heatmap to show age-adjusted mortality rates by state and year.
4. **Life Expectancy Analysis**: Visualize the average life expectancy by country.
5. **Combined Data Analysis**: Integrate CDC and WHO data to analyze the relationship between deaths and life expectancy.

## Data Sources

- **CDC Data**: Mortality data sourced from the CDC's public databases, including crude death rates, age-adjusted rates, and related metrics.
- **WHO Data**: Life expectancy data sourced from the WHO's Global Health Observatory (GHO) database.

## Tools and Technologies

- **Python**: The primary programming language used for data processing and analysis.
- **Pandas**: Used for data manipulation and cleaning.
- **Plotly**: Utilized for creating interactive visualizations.
- **Dash**: Framework used to build the interactive dashboard.
- **Google Colab**: Environment for developing and testing the code.

## Key Steps and Methodologies

1. **Data Acquisition**: Data was fetched from CDC and WHO APIs, ensuring real-time access and updates.
2. **Data Cleaning and Preprocessing**: Both datasets were cleaned and preprocessed to ensure consistency and compatibility for merging and analysis.
3. **Trend Analysis**: Trends in mortality rates were analyzed and visualized using line charts.
4. **Correlation Analysis**: The relationship between age-adjusted mortality rates and deaths was explored through scatter plots and correlation coefficients.
5. **Heatmap Visualization**: A heatmap was created to display age-adjusted mortality rates by state and year.
6. **Life Expectancy Analysis**: Average life expectancy by country was visualized using bar charts.
7. **Combined Data Analysis**: CDC and WHO data were merged to analyze the combined effects on mortality and life expectancy.

## Dashboard Features

- **Trend Analysis Tab**: Displays the trend of mortality rates over the years using line charts.
- **Correlation Analysis Tab**: Shows the correlation between age-adjusted mortality rates and deaths using scatter plots with trendlines.
- **Heatmap Analysis Tab**: Provides a heatmap visualization of age-adjusted mortality rates by state and year.
- **Life Expectancy Tab**: Visualizes the average life expectancy by country using bar charts.
- **Combined Data Analysis Tab**: Combines CDC and WHO data to analyze deaths and life expectancy through scatter plots.

### Data Visualization and Insights

The project analyzes health inequities by examining mortality rates and life expectancy data from the CDC and WHO. The heatmap of age-adjusted mortality rates by state and year reveals significant disparities, with states like Tennessee and South Carolina consistently showing higher mortality rates, while states like California and Arizona exhibit lower rates. This pattern suggests geographic disparities in health outcomes that may be influenced by factors such as access to healthcare, socioeconomic conditions, and public health policies.

The bar chart showcasing average life expectancy by country highlights stark contrasts across nations. Developed countries such as Switzerland and Japan boast higher life expectancies, whereas developing countries like Afghanistan and Zambia report lower figures. These disparities underscore the impact of economic development, healthcare infrastructure, and social determinants of health on population longevity.

The combined analysis of deaths and life expectancy further emphasizes the complex relationship between mortality and life expectancy. Although there is no clear linear correlation, clusters of states with high death rates tend to fall within specific life expectancy ranges, indicating potential areas for targeted interventions.

The scatter plot examining the correlation between age-adjusted mortality rates and deaths, with a trendline, demonstrates a positive but weak correlation (approximately 0.065). This suggests that while higher age-adjusted mortality rates are associated with higher numbers of deaths, other factors also significantly influence mortality outcomes.

Finally, the trend analysis of mortality rates over the years reveals a concerning increase, particularly since the early 2000s. This upward trajectory highlights the growing public health challenge and the need for continuous monitoring and intervention to address the underlying causes of rising mortality rates.

These visualizations collectively provide a comprehensive understanding of health inequities, emphasizing the need for targeted public health strategies to address disparities in mortality and life expectancy across different regions and populations.

## Insights for Minnesota
Trend of Mortality Rates Over Years in Minnesota: The trend analysis of mortality rates in Minnesota reveals a steady increase in the number of deaths from the year 1999 to 2016. Starting from just over 100 deaths in 1999, the number has risen consistently, reaching nearly 700 deaths by 2016. This increasing trend highlights a growing concern for public health and the need for effective interventions to curb the rising mortality rates in the state.


Combined Analysis of Deaths and Life Expectancy in Minnesota: The combined analysis of deaths and life expectancy in Minnesota shows a rather sparse data distribution. This might indicate data limitations or the need for further detailed datasets to comprehensively analyze the relationship between the number of deaths and the average life expectancy in the state.


Correlation between Age-Adjusted Mortality Rate and Deaths in Minnesota: The scatter plot for Minnesota shows a strong positive correlation between the age-adjusted mortality rate and the number of deaths. As the age-adjusted mortality rate increases, the number of deaths also increases, indicating that higher mortality rates are associated with more deaths in the state. This correlation is visually represented with a clear upward trend line in the scatter plot.


Average Life Expectancy by Year in Minnesota: The bar chart for average life expectancy by year in Minnesota did not provide a detailed visual output due to limited data. More comprehensive life expectancy data over the years would be beneficial to analyze trends and make meaningful interpretations for Minnesota.


In conclusion, the detailed analysis for Minnesota showcases a concerning rise in mortality rates over the years and a strong correlation between age-adjusted mortality rates and the number of deaths. These findings underscore the importance of focused public health strategies and continuous monitoring to address the underlying causes and improve health outcomes in Minnesota.
